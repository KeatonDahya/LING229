        "# **Conclusion**\n",
        "\n",
        "The analysis of the corpus of Charles Dickens' works reveals valuable insights into his use of language and the thematic richness of his writing. The examination of type/token ratios highlights an expected pattern: longer texts exhibit lower lexical diversity due to increased repetition of common words. This trend aligns with the nature of narrative storytelling, where certain words (e.g., articles, conjunctions, or thematic terms) are frequently reused. At the same time, shorter texts maintain higher diversity, indicating less repetition and possibly more concentrated linguistic variety.\n",
        "\n",
        "The frequency distribution of words further deepens our understanding of Dickens' corpus. Stop words like \"the,\" \"and,\" and \"of\" dominate the word frequency rankings, as expected, given their structural role in the English language. However, removing these stop words uncovered more meaningful patterns, including the prominence of thematic terms and character names. For instance, key words such as \"justice,\" \"love,\" and \"family\" appear frequently and are central to understanding the themes Dickens explores in his novels.\n",
        "\n",
        "The unique analysis of the word \"justice\" across texts using the .concordance function provided an intriguing look at its contextual usage. In A Tale of Two Cities, \"justice\" is tied to revolutionary ideals, while in Great Expectations, it reflects personal struggles and moral dilemmas. This contextual exploration highlights how Dickens' language adapts to the themes and settings of his novels, enriching the reader's understanding of his storytelling.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite these findings, certain aspects remain unexplored. For example, examining how Dickens' language evolves over time or comparing his works to other authors of the same period could provide broader insights. Additionally, incorporating texts from different genres or categories (e.g., non-fiction or letters) into the corpus could reveal how his style varies across different contexts.\n",
        "\n",
        "This corpus and analysis offer valuable tools for understanding Dickens' contributions to English literature and language. By exploring lexical diversity, word frequency, and contextual usage, I gain a deeper appreciation of his linguistic artistry. For future research, integrating advanced natural language processing techniques, such as sentiment analysis or topic modeling, could further illuminate the nuances of his work and its impact on readers."
